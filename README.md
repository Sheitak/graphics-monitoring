## Weather Monitoring

This starter kit is here to easily start a repository.

It's symfony website-skeleton project with some additional tools to validate code standards.

* GrumPHP, as pre-commit hook, will run 2 tools when `git commit` is run :
  
    * PHP_CodeSniffer to check PSR2 
    * PHPStan will check PHP recommendation
     
  If tests fail, the commit is canceled and a warning message is displayed to developper.

* Travis CI, as Continuous Integration will be run when a branch with active pull request is updated on github. It will run :

    * Tasks to check if vendor, .idea, env.local are not versionned,
    * PHP_CodeSniffer to check PSR2,
    * PHPStan will check PHP recommendation.
